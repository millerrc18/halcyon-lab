# Changelog

## 2026-03-27 — Dashboard Polish Sprint

### New Features
- **Research Docs on Cloud** — 35+ markdown docs served via `research_docs` Postgres table with category sidebar and search
- **Council Session Detail View** — Expandable session rows with full agent vote cards, vote distribution chart, dissent highlighting
- **Activity Feed Cloud Polling** — Polling fallback for cloud mode (60s) with event-type icons
- **Live Trade Ledger** — New page for $100 Alpaca live account with equity curve, open/closed tables, header metrics
- **Shadow Ledger Enhancements** — Metrics strip (equity, PF, DD), expandable trade detail rows, 4 viz tabs (equity curve, distribution, sector heatmap, calendar)
- **Hardware Roadmap** — Phase 2 and Phase 4 build specs with costs and unlock descriptions
- **Monthly Cost Timeline** — Visual bar chart of per-phase monthly costs

### Fixes
- **Audit Banner** — Parses raw JSON/code fences from audit summary, shows clean text
- **Shadow Equity** — Uses `shadow/account` endpoint (starting_capital + closed_pnl) instead of potentially wrong `alpaca_equity`
- **KPI Thresholds** — Sharpe/Win Rate show with >= 2 trades (was >= 5)
- **Confidence Calibration** — Shows "< X/50 trades" instead of "--"
- **Rubric Score** — Shows "Not scored yet" with tooltip instead of "n/a"
- **Health Score Dimensions** — All 5 dimensions (Performance, Model Quality, Data Asset, Flywheel, Defensibility) now computed from real data with metric breakdowns
- **Review Tab Removed** — Replaced with Live Ledger in sidebar navigation
