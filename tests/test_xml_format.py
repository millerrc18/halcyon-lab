<why_now>
AAPL is pulling back 3.2% from its 50-day high into a rising 50-day MA, with RSI at 58 — a textbook continuation setup.
</why_now>

<analysis>
The thesis here is simple: Apple's trend structure remains intact with the 50-day MA rising at 0.8% slope, and this pullback offers a defined-risk entry into what has been the market's most reliable large-cap name.

Relative strength confirms the setup. AAPL has outperformed SPY by 4.2% over the past 3 months, with the RS line making new highs even as price consolidates. This divergence typically resolves higher.

Volume is contracting into the pullback — the 20-day volume ratio sits at 0.78x, suggesting sellers are exhausted rather than aggressive. The ATR(14) at $2.85 gives us a tight 1.5% risk from entry to stop.

The risk here is a broader market regime shift. SPY's RSI at 52 and breadth at 58% above the 50-day MA are acceptable but not strong. A VIX spike above 20 would invalidate this as a low-volatility continuation trade.
