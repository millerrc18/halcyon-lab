---

## Training Pipeline State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total examples | 978 |
| Sources | 704 historical_backfill, 194 blinded_win, 77 blinded_loss, 3 synthetic_claude |
| Curriculum stages | 976 structure, 0 evidence, 0 decision, 2 null |
| Quality scores (Claude) | 0/978 scored |
| Quality scores (Ollama) | ~200 scored (avg 3.1-3.2) |

### Training Data Issues Found (7)
1. 🔴 Format mismatch: training data has markdown headers + bold, parser expects clean XML
2. 🔴 976/978 examples are curriculum_stage "structure" — 3-stage curriculum unused
3. 🟡 Conviction format: `5.5/10` with bold, parser regex only matches integers
4. 🟡 Zero Claude quality scores across all 978 examples
5. 🟡 704 backfill examples missing regime context
6. ✅ Self-blinding working correctly
7. ✅ Data collector architecture is clean

## 18-Month Roadmap Summary

| Quarter | Phase | Key Milestone | Gate |
|---------|-------|---------------|------|
| Q1 (Apr-Jun 2026) | Bootcamp hardening | 50 closed trades, 2,200 examples | Win rate ≥45%, PF ≥1.3, DD ≤12% |
| Q2 (Jul-Sep 2026) | Walk-forward + LLC | 100 trades, Wyoming LLC formed | PSR >90%, Sharpe >0 |
| Q3 (Oct-Dec 2026) | Breakout R&D + scaling | 200 trades, 5,000 examples | Sharpe ≥1.0, PSR ≥95% |
| Q4 (Jan-Mar 2027) | Capital scaling | $100→$1,000 live, breakout paper | PSR >90%, DD <15% |
| Q5 (Apr-Jun 2027) | Investor readiness | 500 trades, $5K-$10K live | DSR >0.95, PSR ≥99% |

### Capital Scaling Gates (performance-based, not time-based)
- $100 → $1,000: 100+ trades, PSR >90%, DD <15%
- $1,000 → $5,000: 100-150 more trades, PSR >90% Sharpe >0.2
- $5,000 → $10,000: Another 100-150 trades, DSR >0.95

### API Budget Plan ($100 total)
- Months 1-3: ~$30 (quality scoring existing examples, regime gap filling)
- Months 4-9: ~$40 (DPO pairs from live trades, scoring new examples)
- Months 10-18: ~$30 (regime-diverse corner cases, GRPO reward data)

## Pending Manual Actions

### Urgent (before market open)
- [ ] Change API_SECRET on Render from test123
- [ ] Change starting_capital: 1000 → 100000 in settings.local.yaml
- [ ] Change risk_governor.max_open_positions: 10 → 50 in settings.local.yaml

### This Weekend
- [ ] Rotate Anthropic API key (exposed in conversation)
- [ ] Rotate Finnhub API key (exposed in conversation)
- [ ] Buy $100 Anthropic API credits (prepaid Visa)
- [ ] Set up Termius SSH on phone → Tailscale IP

### When CC Finishes Sprint v5
- [ ] git pull + restart watch loop
- [ ] Run render_migrate.py (if new tables added)
- [ ] Verify all dashboard pages work on halcyonlab.app

### When CC Finishes Follow-up #1
- [ ] Run training data cleanup scripts (5 scripts in order)
- [ ] Run quality scoring on all 978 examples (~$5-8 API)
- [ ] Verify 100% parser success rate

### Weekly Ritual (Sunday nights)
- [ ] Export 20 recent training examples → upload for Claude review
- [ ] Upload halcyon.log for anomaly analysis
- [ ] Screenshot dashboard → review with Claude
- [ ] Review research digest (once collector #13 is live)
- [ ] Prepare Monday action items

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Business model:** Returns-based fund, not newsletter/signals. Scale capital, not subscriptions.
2. **Training data is the moat.** Not the model, not the returns — the curated, regime-diverse, live-anchored training corpus.
3. **Self-blinding is architectural, not instructional.** Claude never sees outcomes during training data generation.
4. **Separate LoRA adapters per strategy.** Pullback and breakout get independent models.
5. **Performance-gated milestones.** Every phase transition requires passing quantitative gates.
6. **50 trades is a filter, not a verdict.** 200+ trades needed for moderate edge detection.
7. **The $100 live account is strategically essential.** Auditable real-money track record for institutional capital.
8. **Weekly Saturday retrain, not nightly.** 90% lower cost, equal results.
9. **Keep Claude API for council + training data.** Local LLM for these tasks causes model collapse.
10. **Wyoming LLC in Phase 2.** Section 475 MTM within 75 days of formation.
