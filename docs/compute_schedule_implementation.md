# 24/7 Compute Schedule Implementation Report

## Summary

Implemented a full 24/7 GPU compute schedule that fills every dead window in the watch loop with high-value batch work. The existing scan pipeline, overnight data collection, and all current functionality continue to work identically.

## Architecture

### Phase 1: GuardedScorer — Between-Scan Inference Scoring
**File:** `src/scheduler/scorer.py`

- Scores unscored training examples using the already-loaded Ollama model between market scans
- Zero VRAM overhead — reuses the inference model already in memory
- 3-minute guard band before each scan guarantees zero interference
- Scoring windows: minutes 8-27 and 38-57 of each hour during market hours
- Skips first window of day (system stabilization) and last 30 min before close
- Safety cap of 50 examples per window to prevent runaway
- Uses same process-first rubric as Claude API scoring (6 dimensions, weighted)
- Estimated throughput: ~420 examples/day

### Phase 2: VRAM Handoff Protocol — Overnight Training
**Files:** `src/scheduler/vram_manager.py`, `src/scheduler/overnight.py`, `scripts/overnight_train.py`

**VRAMManager:**
- Evening handoff (6:50 PM): Unload Ollama → verify VRAM < 500MB → launch training subprocess
- Morning handoff (5:15 AM): SIGTERM training → verify VRAM clear → reload Ollama → warm up
- nvidia-smi path auto-discovery for Windows (checks System32, NVSMI, PATH)
- Training runs as subprocess for clean VRAM isolation (OS reclaims all CUDA memory on exit)
- STOP_OVERNIGHT flag file for graceful shutdown signaling

**OvernightPipeline (7 tasks, ~10.3 hours):**
1. Holdout evaluation (walk-forward backtesting)
2. DPO preference pair generation
3. Feature importance computation
4. Leakage detection (outcome contamination probe)
5. Rolling statistics computation
6. Database maintenance (VACUUM + ANALYZE)
7. Health check and metric snapshot

Each task: logged to `overnight_run_log` table, has timeout, no cascade on failure, checks STOP_FLAG before starting.

### Phase 3: Pre-Market Inference Block (6:00-9:25 AM)
**File:** `src/scheduler/premarket.py`

After morning VRAM handoff loads Ollama at 5:15 AM, fills ~3.5 hours with:
- **6:02 AM** — Rolling feature computation (VIX term structure, macro, options metrics)
- **7:00 AM** — Ollama warm verification + self-blinded training data generation
- **8:02 AM** — Overnight news scoring (Ollama rates market impact 1-5 for top 20 tickers)
- **9:00 AM** — Pre-market candidate analysis (lightweight pre-scan of top 20)
- **9:25 AM** — Guard band (5 min clear before first scan)

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Metrics
**File:** `src/scheduler/metrics.py`

- `schedule_metrics` table: date-indexed, supports upsert for running totals
- `GET /api/schedule-metrics?days=30` — Returns today's running totals + 30-day history
- Metric names: `examples_scored`, `vram_handoff_success`, `overnight_tasks_completed`, etc.

## Watch Loop Integration

All new features integrated into `src/scheduler/watch.py`:
- GuardedScorer runs as independent `if` block (not in `elif` chain) during market hours
- VRAM handoffs at 5:15 AM and 6:50 PM in the overnight schedule block
- Pre-market tasks at 6:02, 7:00, 8:02, 9:00 AM in the overnight schedule block
- Daily scored count in status log
- All new flags reset at midnight via `_reset_daily_state()`
- Startup banner shows compute schedule status

## Graceful Degradation

- If GuardedScorer fails: scoring stops, scans unaffected (wrapped in try/except)
- If VRAM handoff fails: stays in inference mode, logs error, no crash
- If overnight task fails: next task runs (no cascade), logged to `overnight_run_log`
- If pre-market task fails: wrapped in `_safe_run()`, other tasks continue
- If nvidia-smi not found: VRAM monitoring returns -1, handoffs use time-based waits
