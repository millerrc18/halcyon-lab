# Quantitative regime detection for the Halcyon Lab trading system

**The most impactful upgrade path for Halcyon Lab's Traffic Light system is a 2-state Hidden Markov Model ensemble combined with Statistical Jump Models, VIX term structure features, and continuous position sizing — delivering an estimated 15–25% drawdown reduction with Sharpe improvement of 0.05–0.15 after costs.** This matters because your current discrete 3-bucket approach (green/yellow/red) leaves significant edge on the table: continuous regime probabilities allow smoother position transitions that reduce whipsaw costs while capturing more of the uptrend exposure your pullback system needs. The research base spans Hamilton's foundational 1989 work through cutting-edge 2024–2026 papers, with the Statistical Jump Model emerging as the strongest practical alternative to classical HMMs. Below is the complete technical specification for each method, with mathematical formulations, academic evidence, code, and an integration architecture.

---

## 1. Hidden Markov Models: the foundational framework

### Hamilton (1989) original specification

James Hamilton's "A New Approach to the Economic Analysis of Nonstationary Time Series and the Business Cycle" (*Econometrica*, 57(2), pp. 357–384) introduced regime-switching models to economics. The observation equation for the simplest equity adaptation is:

$$y_t = \mu_{S_t} + \sigma_{S_t} \cdot \varepsilon_t, \quad \varepsilon_t \sim N(0,1)$$

where $S_t \in \{1, 2\}$ follows a first-order Markov chain with transition matrix:

$$P = \begin{bmatrix} p_{11} & 1-p_{11} \\ 1-p_{22} & p_{22} \end{bmatrix}$$

**Six parameters** require estimation for a 2-state Gaussian model: $\theta = (\mu_1, \mu_2, \sigma_1, \sigma_2, p_{11}, p_{22})$. The Hamilton filter — the forward algorithm — recursively computes filtered probabilities $\xi_{j,t} = P(S_t = j \mid y_1, \ldots, y_t)$ via:

1. **Regime-conditional density:** $\eta_{j,t} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_j^2}} \exp\left[-\frac{(y_t - \mu_j)^2}{2\sigma_j^2}\right]$
2. **Prediction step:** $f(y_t \mid \Omega_{t-1}) = \sum_i \sum_j p_{ij} \cdot \xi_{i,t-1} \cdot \eta_{j,t}$
3. **Update step:** $\xi_{j,t} = \frac{\sum_i p_{ij} \cdot \xi_{i,t-1} \cdot \eta_{j,t}}{f(y_t \mid \Omega_{t-1})}$

The log-likelihood $\log L(\theta) = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log f(y_t \mid \Omega_{t-1})$ is maximized via EM (Baum-Welch). Hamilton originally applied this to quarterly US GNP growth; adaptation to equity returns followed in Hamilton & Susmel (1994, *Journal of Econometrics*) and Turner, Startz & Nelson (1989). The Kim (1994) smoothing algorithm provides $\xi_{t|T} = P(S_t = j \mid y_1, \ldots, y_T)$ using all data — but **only filtered probabilities are usable in live trading**.

### Two states dominate for equity applications

The literature strongly favors **2 states (bull/bear) for tactical trading** and 3–4 states only for strategic multi-asset allocation. Ang & Bekaert (2002, *Review of Financial Studies*, 15(4), pp. 1137–1187) used 2 states for international equity allocation, identifying a normal regime and a bear regime with lower returns, higher volatility, and higher cross-market correlations. Both self-transition probabilities exceeded 95%, confirming regime persistence. Hardy (2001, *North American Actuarial Journal*, 5(2), pp. 41–53) fit a 2-state regime-switching lognormal model to S&P 500 monthly data, finding superior fit versus GARCH.

Guidolin & Timmermann (2007, *Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control*, 31(11), pp. 3503–3544) found statistical support for **4 states** (crash, slow growth, bull, recovery) when modeling joint stock-bond returns — but this required 552 monthly observations and the parameter count exploded to ~48. The **overfitting risk scales as $O(K^2 + 2K)$** for $K$ states in a univariate Gaussian HMM. A practical rule requires **30–50 observations per parameter per state**, meaning a 4-state daily model needs roughly 1,440–2,400 observations per state. BIC is the preferred selection criterion because it penalizes complexity more heavily than AIC, though standard likelihood ratio tests fail due to the Davies (1977) nuisance parameter problem under the null (Garcia, 1998).

**For Halcyon Lab's 2–15 day holding period pullback system, 2 states is optimal.** Adding a third "neutral" state offers marginal benefit but roughly doubles the parameter count and increases detection lag. The economic interpretation is clean: State 1 (bull) has positive mean return and low volatility, State 2 (bear) has negative or zero mean return and high volatility. Your pullback-in-uptrend trades are ideally suited to State 1; State 2 demands reduced or zero exposure.

### Detection lag: 5–15 days for bear onset, 15–30 days for recovery

Detection lag — the number of observations for filtered probability to reach 90% after a true regime change — is **asymmetric** and depends on the signal-to-noise ratio $|\mu_1 - \mu_2| / \sqrt{\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2}$. Nystrup et al. (2015, *Journal of Portfolio Management*, 42(1), pp. 103–109) found that their switching strategy "is much better at timing the downturns than the rebounds." Bear regimes produce large negative returns with high volatility — **highly informative** observations that rapidly shift the filtered probability. A daily S&P 500 return of −3% in a bull regime with $\mu_1 = +0.04\%$, $\sigma_1 = 0.8\%$ versus a bear regime with $\mu_2 = -0.10\%$, $\sigma_2 = 1.8\%$ produces a massive likelihood ratio favoring the high-volatility state. Recoveries are slower to detect because volatility remains elevated during early bull markets.

**Reducing detection lag** is possible through three approaches. First, multivariate observations — adding VIX or credit spreads — reduce lag by **2–5 days** (Nystrup et al., 2016, *Journal of Asset Management*, 17(5), pp. 361–374). Second, time-varying transition probabilities (Filardo, 1994; Diebold, Lee & Weinbach, 1994) allow faster switching. Third, Statistical Jump Models produce more persistent state sequences with fewer false alarms (Nystrup et al., 2020).

### Online updating and re-estimation frequency

The Hamilton filter is **naturally recursive** — filtered probabilities update in $O(K^2)$ per observation using only the previous probability vector, the new observation, and current parameters. This means **filtered probabilities can be updated daily with zero computational cost even when model parameters are fixed.** The distinction between daily probability updates and periodic parameter re-estimation is crucial.

For parameter re-estimation, the consensus recommendation is a **rolling window of 2,000–3,000 trading days (~8–12 years), retrained monthly or quarterly**. Nystrup et al. (2017, *Journal of Forecasting*, 36(8), pp. 989–1002) introduced HMMs with time-varying parameters using exponentially weighted sufficient statistics — effectively a "forgetting factor" that adapts to non-stationary markets. Rolling windows outperform expanding windows because they prevent distant structural regimes (e.g., 1970s inflation) from dominating current parameter estimates.

Cappé (2011, *Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics*, 20(3)) developed a formal online EM algorithm for HMMs that updates sufficient statistics incrementally: $\hat{S}_{n+1} = \gamma_{n+1} \cdot E[s(X_{n+1}, Y_{n+1}) \mid Y_{n+1}] + (1-\gamma_{n+1}) \cdot \hat{S}_n$, where step-sizes $\gamma_n$ satisfy stochastic approximation conditions. This reaches MLE-equivalent quality for large samples but converges slowly initially.

### Ang & Bekaert portfolio results

Ang & Bekaert (2002, *Review of Financial Studies*) demonstrated that regime-switching strategies **dominate static strategies out-of-sample** for all-equity international portfolios. Their 2004 paper (*Financial Analysts Journal*, 60(2), pp. 86–99) extended this to multi-asset allocation (cash, bonds, equities), finding that "substantial value is added when an investor chooses between cash, bonds and equity investments. When a persistent bear market hits, the investor switches primarily to **cash**." The key mechanism: bear regimes coincide with relatively high interest rates, creating large timing benefits. Optimal weights were computed via Gaussian quadrature numerical methods over a grid of state probability values, using Bellman equation dynamic programming. Portfolio weights mapped continuously from filtered probabilities — **not discrete regime labels**.

## 2. Statistical Jump Models: the strongest practical alternative

### A discriminative alternative to generative HMMs

Statistical Jump Models (SJMs), introduced by Nystrup, Lindström & Madsen (2020, *Expert Systems with Applications*, 150:113307) building on Bemporad, Breschi, Piga & Boyd (2018, *Automatica*, 96:11–21), replace HMMs' probabilistic generative framework with a **direct optimization approach**. While HMMs maximize $P(X \mid \Theta)$ through the EM algorithm, SJMs minimize a penalized loss:

$$\min_{\Theta, S} \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \ell(y_t, \theta_{s_t}) + \lambda \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \mathbb{1}\{s_{t-1} \neq s_t\}$$

where $\ell$ is any loss function (typically squared Euclidean for k-means-style clustering), $s_t \in \{1, \ldots, K\}$ are hidden states, $\theta_{s_t}$ are state-conditional parameters (centroids), and **$\lambda \geq 0$ is the jump penalty** — the single hyperparameter that controls regime persistence. The algorithm alternates between fixing the state sequence and optimizing parameters (convex), then fixing parameters and optimizing states via dynamic programming (globally optimal Viterbi-style step). Multiple random initializations (typically 10) ensure convergence to a good solution within ~10 iterations.

**Five concrete advantages over HMMs make SJMs compelling for Halcyon Lab:**

- **Enhanced persistence**: The jump penalty $\lambda$ provides explicit control over switching frequency. HMMs frequently produce unrealistically rapid state flickering when the emission distributions are poorly specified — exactly the problem with daily equity returns that aren't truly Gaussian.
- **No distributional assumptions**: SJMs impose no parametric form on the observations. This matters because daily returns exhibit fat tails, asymmetric volatility, and serial correlation that violate Gaussian HMM assumptions.
- **Direct optimization of a prediction objective**: Shu, Yu & Mulvey (2024, *Journal of Asset Management*, 25(5):493–507; arXiv:2402.05272) use time-series cross-validation to select $\lambda$ by directly optimizing the downstream strategy's Sharpe ratio — aligning the regime detection with the trading objective.
- **Robust out-of-sample evidence**: Shu et al. (2024) tested a 0/1 strategy (fully invested in bull, cash in bear) on S&P 500, DAX, and Nikkei 225 from 1990–2023, with transaction costs and 1-day trading delay. The JM-guided strategy **consistently outperformed both HMM-guided strategies and buy-and-hold** across all three markets, with lower volatility, lower maximum drawdown, and higher Sharpe ratios.
- **Mature implementation**: The `jumpmodels` package on PyPI (pip install jumpmodels) provides a scikit-learn-style API with `.fit()`, `.predict()`, `.predict_proba()`, and `.predict_online()` methods. It implements the original discrete Jump Model, Continuous Jump Model (CJM), and Sparse Jump Model with feature selection.

```python
# --- Statistical Jump Model example ---
# pip install jumpmodels
from jumpmodels import JumpModel
import numpy as np

# Features: rolling 20-day return + rolling 20-day volatility
features = pd.DataFrame({
    'roll_ret': returns.rolling(20).mean(),
    'roll_vol': returns.rolling(20).std()
}).dropna().values

# Fit 2-state Jump Model with jump penalty
jm = JumpModel(n_components=2, jump_penalty=15.0, random_state=42)
jm.fit(features)

states = jm.predict(features)
probs = jm.predict_proba(features)

# Online prediction for new observation
new_obs = features[-1:].reshape(1, -1)
online_state = jm.predict_online(new_obs)
```

The growing body of follow-up work includes Shu & Mulvey (2024) on dynamic factor allocation, Aydınhan, Kolm, Mulvey & Shu (2024, *Annals of Operations Research*) on continuous jump models, Bosancic, Nie & Mulvey (2024, *Journal of Financial Data Science*, 6(3):10–37) on regime-aware factor allocation, and Cortese, Kolm & Lindström (2024) on generalized information criteria for high-dimensional SJMs.

## 3. Wasserstein HMM: promising but early-stage

Boukardagha (2026, arXiv:2603.04441, Columbia University) proposed an architecture wrapping standard Gaussian HMMs with three innovations: rolling re-estimation with strict causality, **predictive model-order selection** that dynamically adjusts $K$ over time, and **Wasserstein template matching** to solve the label-switching problem. The key innovation uses the 2-Wasserstein distance between Gaussian distributions:

$$W_2^2(\mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \Sigma_1), \mathcal{N}(\mu_2, \Sigma_2)) = \|\mu_1 - \mu_2\|^2 + \text{Tr}\left(\Sigma_1 + \Sigma_2 - 2(\Sigma_2^{1/2}\Sigma_1\Sigma_2^{1/2})^{1/2}\right)$$

Persistent templates $\Theta_g = (\mu_g, \Sigma_g)$ represent economically stable regime identities. Each HMM component is mapped to the nearest template via this distance, with templates updated through exponential smoothing. This elegantly solves the combinatorial label-matching problem that plagues rolling HMM deployments.

The claimed results — **Sharpe 2.18 versus 1.18 buy-and-hold, maximum drawdown −5.43% versus −14.62%** — come from a 2005–2026 backtest on a 5-asset cross-asset universe (SPX, bonds, gold, oil, USD). These numbers warrant **healthy skepticism**: the paper is a single-author preprint with no peer review, no public code, no independent replication, and the 5-asset cross-asset universe makes high Sharpes more achievable than single-asset equity trading. The core Wasserstein template concept is theoretically sound and addresses a genuine operational problem, but **production deployment would be premature** without further validation. CPU-only computation is sufficient — the method uses standard Gaussian HMM fitting plus closed-form Wasserstein distances.

**Recommendation for Halcyon Lab**: Monitor this approach. The label-switching solution is valuable and could be implemented independently atop your HMM without adopting the full architecture. The related Hirsa, Xu & Malhotra (2024, SSRN 4729435) "Robust Rolling Regime Detection" framework provides a peer-reviewed alternative addressing the same operational challenge.

## 4. VIX term structure: the fastest regime signal available

### Core signals and their empirical power

The VIX term structure — spanning VIX9D (9-day), VIX (30-day), VIX3M (3-month), and VIX1Y (1-year) implied volatility — provides the **most immediate market-based regime information** available. Normal markets exhibit contango (upward-sloping, short-term < long-term) approximately **80–84% of the time**. Backwardation (inverted curve) occurs 16–20% of the time and signals acute near-term stress.

The **VIX/VIX3M ratio** is the gold-standard practitioner signal. Fassas & Hourvouliades (2019, *Journal of Risk and Financial Management*, 12(3):113) found that backwardation (VIX/VIX3M > 1.0) is a statistically significant **contrarian buy signal** for S&P 500 returns, with the effect strengthening at longer horizons (coefficient −0.17 for daily, −1.18 for quarterly). Contango showed no significant predictive power — markets stay complacent longer than they panic. Simon & Campasano (2014, *Journal of Derivatives*, 21(3):54–69) found that the VIX futures basis predicts VIX futures returns (not spot VIX changes), generating **3.4% monthly four-factor alpha** for a hedged strategy with Sharpe ratio 0.36.

The **VIX9D/VIX ratio** provides the earliest warning. A hierarchy of crossover severity exists: VIX9D > VIX (minor), VIX > VIX3M (meaningful), VIX > VIX1Y (rare and serious), full inversion VIX9D > VIX > VIX3M > VIX1Y (extremely rare, signals persistent stress). During the February 5, 2018 "Volmageddon," VIX9D crossed above VIX before the crash, providing early warning.

**VVIX (volatility of VIX)** provides an institutional positioning signal. Park (2015, *Journal of Financial Markets*, 26:38–63) showed VVIX forecasts future tail-risk hedge returns and is "more relevant for measuring tail risk than the VIX itself." Key levels: 85–95 (normal), >110 (regime change threshold — all major crashes saw sustained readings above 110), >125 (contrarian: SPY positive 70% of the time over forward 5/10/20 days). The critical divergence signal — VVIX rising while VIX stays flat — indicates institutional pre-positioning for a vol spike.

### Derived features for Halcyon Lab's term structure data

Johnson (2017, *Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis*, 52(6):2461–2490) demonstrated that PCA on the VIX term structure produces three components where the **SLOPE (2nd PC) is the single most informative factor** for variance risk premia, predicting returns across variance swaps, VIX futures, and straddles at all maturities. Luo & Zhang (2012, *Journal of Futures Markets*, 32(12):1092–1123) confirmed that both level and slope contain forecasting information.

With VIX9D, VIX, VIX3M, VIX1Y available, construct these features ranked by predictive power:

```python
# --- VIX Term Structure Feature Engineering ---
def vix_features(vix9d, vix, vix3m, vix1y):
    features = {}
    # Ratios (direct regime signals)
    features['vix_vix3m_ratio'] = vix / vix3m       # <1 = contango (safe)
    features['vix9d_vix_ratio'] = vix9d / vix        # >1 = immediate stress
    features['vix_vix1y_ratio'] = vix / vix1y        # >1 = deep inversion
    features['vix3m_vix1y_ratio'] = vix3m / vix1y    # back-end slope

    # Normalized slopes
    features['front_slope'] = (vix3m - vix) / vix
    features['total_slope'] = (vix1y - vix) / vix
    features['back_slope'] = (vix1y - vix3m) / vix3m

    # Curvature (second derivative of term structure)
    features['front_curvature'] = vix9d - 2*vix + vix3m
    features['back_curvature'] = vix - 2*vix3m + vix1y

    # Binary inversion indicators
    features['full_inversion'] = int(
        (vix9d > vix) and (vix > vix3m) and (vix3m > vix1y)
    )
    return features
```

Use **rolling z-scores** (60-day or 120-day window) of VIX/VIX3M and VIX9D/VIX for stationarity. The rate of change of term structure slope captures regime transition speed. Mixon (2007, *Journal of Empirical Finance*, 14(3):333–354) found that the IV term structure slope has some predictive ability for future short-dated IV, though less than expectations hypothesis predicts due to time-varying risk premia.

### Integration with HMM regime detection

VIX term structure features can serve as **HMM observation variables** directly — Nystrup et al. (2016) showed that adding VIX to S&P 500 returns improves change-point detection. Alternatively, use VIX signals as a **confirming/filtering layer** in an ensemble: the HMM captures gradual regime shifts while VIX term structure signals detect sharp transitions. Aigner (2023, SSRN #4389763) demonstrated a 4-state Gaussian mixture HMM fitted to VIX history, showing "promising application in modelling and predicting volatility." For practical purposes, feed 2–3 VIX-derived features (VIX/VIX3M ratio, front slope, VIX level z-score) as additional observations into a multivariate HMM alongside equity returns and realized volatility — but keep the total feature count below 4–5 to avoid the curse of dimensionality that Nystrup et al. (2019) warned degrades HMM estimation quality.

## 5. Ensemble regime detection: combining signals without overfitting

### Architecture and combination methods

No single regime detection method dominates across all market conditions — HMMs excel at temporal persistence (85–95% daily state survival probability), VIX term structure captures immediate stress, and credit spreads provide independent default-risk information. The ensemble architecture has four base models producing continuous regime probabilities:

**Layer 0 — Base Models:**
1. HMM (2-state, daily returns + realized vol) → $P(\text{bear})_{\text{HMM}}$
2. Statistical Jump Model (2-state, rolling features) → $P(\text{bear})_{\text{SJM}}$
3. VIX term structure composite (VIX/VIX3M z-score + slope) → $P(\text{bear})_{\text{VIX}}$
4. Rules-based (existing Traffic Light upgraded to continuous) → $P(\text{bear})_{\text{rules}}$

**Layer 1 — Combination:** The three standard approaches are simple averaging, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), and stacking.

**Bayesian Model Averaging** (Shi, 2016, *Journal of Forecasting*; Guérin & Leiva-Leon, 2014, *Economics Letters*) combines models using posterior weights:

$$P(\text{regime} \mid D) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} w_k \cdot P_k(\text{regime} \mid D), \quad w_k = \frac{P(D \mid M_k) \cdot P(M_k)}{\sum_j P(D \mid M_j) \cdot P(M_j)}$$

Dynamic Model Averaging (Raftery et al., 2010) updates weights based on recent predictive accuracy: $w_{k,t} \propto w_{k,t-1}^{\alpha} \cdot f_k(y_t \mid D_{t-1})$, where $\alpha \in (0,1)$ is a forgetting factor. Shi (2016) showed BMA with regime-switching leads to "substantial improvements in forecast performance, particularly in the medium horizon." Elliott & Timmermann (2005, *International Economic Review*, 46(4):1081–1102) derived the theoretical foundations for regime-dependent forecast combination.

**Stacking** uses a meta-learner (logistic regression preferred for parsimony) trained on **walk-forward out-of-fold predictions** to learn the optimal combination function. Critically, the meta-learner must never see in-sample predictions — use expanding-window walk-forward with embargo periods. Gradient boosting can capture nonlinear interactions (e.g., HMM disagrees with VIX but credit confirms → specific regime inference) but introduces more overfitting risk.

### Model disagreement as actionable information

When regime models disagree, **reduce exposure**. The entropy of ensemble predictions measures disagreement:

$$H(p) = -\sum_s p_s \cdot \log(p_s)$$

Maximum entropy (uniform distribution) indicates maximum uncertainty. Bali, Kelly, Mörke & Rahman (2023, NBER Working Paper 31583) demonstrated that machine forecast disagreement is a powerful return predictor: a decile spread portfolio selling high-disagreement stocks earns **14% per year**. The CEPR monetary policy literature confirms that "rules optimised across a wide range of models converge toward cautious and stable policy responses." For position sizing: $\text{size} = \text{base\_size} \times (1 - \lambda_d \cdot H_{\text{normalized}})$, where $\lambda_d \in [0,1]$ controls disagreement sensitivity.

---

## 6. Regime-adaptive position sizing: from discrete buckets to continuous functions

### Continuous probability-to-size mapping

Your current Traffic Light system maps three discrete bins to multipliers. The upgrade uses a **sigmoid function** for smooth transitions:

$$\text{size}(p) = S_{\min} + \frac{S_{\max} - S_{\min}}{1 + \exp(-k \cdot (p_{\text{bull}} - \theta))}$$

where $S_{\max}$ is full position size, $S_{\min}$ is the floor allocation (e.g., 0.15–0.20 to maintain some exposure), $k = 8{-}12$ controls steepness, and $\theta = 0.5$ is the midpoint. Calibrate $k$ and $\theta$ via walk-forward optimization. De Prado's (2023, *Journal of Financial Data Science*, 5(2)) meta-labeling framework provides a rigorous approach: use a secondary model to produce calibrated probabilities (Platt scaling or isotonic regression), then map to position size — uncalibrated probabilities systematically missize positions.

### Regime-weighted Kelly criterion

The standard continuous Kelly fraction $f^* = (\mu - r) / \sigma^2$ becomes regime-dependent:

$$f^* = \sum_s P(S_t = s) \cdot \frac{\mu_s - r}{\sigma_s^2}$$

This smoothly blends regime-specific allocations weighted by posterior probabilities. For typical parameters — bull ($\mu = 12\%$, $\sigma = 14\%$) and bear ($\mu = -15\%$, $\sigma = 28\%$) — the regime-weighted Kelly ranges from strongly positive (high bull probability) to strongly negative (high bear probability). **Half-Kelly ($\lambda = 0.5$)** is essential: it sacrifices ~25% of growth rate but reduces volatility by 50% and dramatically improves drawdowns.

### Volatility targeting as a complementary layer

Moreira & Muir (2017, *Journal of Finance*) showed that scaling equity exposure by inverse realized variance generates **~4.9% annualized alpha**. Their 2019 paper (*Journal of Financial Economics*, 131(3):507–527) found that "a long-term investor who ignores variation in volatility gives up the equivalent of **2.4% of wealth per year**." The formula is simple: $w_t = (\sigma_{\text{target}} / \hat{\sigma}_t) \cdot w_{\text{base}}$. However, Cederburg, O'Doherty, Wang & Yan (2020) identified look-ahead bias concerns, and Bongaerts, Kang & Van Dijk found that **conditional** volatility targeting (adjusting only in extremes) consistently enhances Sharpe ratios with low turnover.

**The optimal approach layers regime detection and volatility targeting:**

$$w_{\text{final}} = \frac{\sigma_{\text{target}}}{\hat{\sigma}_t} \cdot w_{\text{regime}}(p_{\text{bull}})$$

Regime detection determines the base allocation; volatility targeting scales within each regime. This combination is superior because volatility targeting is purely reactive (responds after volatility rises) while regime detection is partially predictive (credit spread widening and VIX term structure inversion precede volatility spikes).

### Realistic performance expectations

After accounting for out-of-sample degradation, transaction costs, and look-ahead bias corrections, **expect Sharpe improvement of 0.05–0.15 and drawdown reduction of 15–25%** versus the current Traffic Light system. Nystrup et al. (2017, *Journal of Portfolio Management*, 44(2):62–73) demonstrated that their HMM-based dynamic strategy outperformed 60/40 benchmarks over 1997–2015 and found an "effective memory length of ~2 years" for HMM estimation. Bailey, Borwein & López de Prado (2014) showed that commonly reported IS Sharpe ratios have **R² < 0.025** for predicting OOS Sharpe — expect 30–60% degradation from backtest to live trading. These are modest improvements, but for Halcyon Lab's pullback system, even a 0.1 Sharpe improvement compounds to significant wealth over years.

## 7. Practical implementation roadmap for Halcyon Lab

### Python library selection

| Feature | hmmlearn | statsmodels MarkovSwitching | jumpmodels |
|---------|----------|---------------------------|------------|
| Model type | Gaussian HMM | Markov regression/autoregression | Statistical Jump Model |
| Multivariate support | Yes (full, diagonal, spherical, tied covariance) | Limited (scalar switching) | Yes (any features) |
| Online updating | No native support (refit required) | No | Yes (`.predict_online()`) |
| GPU support | No | No | No |
| Standard errors / hypothesis tests | No | Yes (full econometric output) | No |
| Information criteria | BIC via `.bic()` | AIC, BIC, HQIC built-in | Cross-validation |
| Speed (2-state, 5000 obs) | ~0.5–2 seconds | ~2–10 seconds | ~1–5 seconds |
| Stability | Good with careful initialization | Good | Good (multiple restarts) |
| Best for | Fast prototyping, multivariate HMMs | Econometric rigor, hypothesis testing | Production regime detection |

**Recommendation**: Use `jumpmodels` as the primary regime detector (best out-of-sample evidence, online prediction, tunable persistence). Use `statsmodels.MarkovSwitching` for validation and econometric diagnostics. Use `hmmlearn` for fast multivariate HMM experiments with VIX term structure features. All three run on CPU — the RTX 3060/3090 provides no benefit for these methods (useful only if you later add deep learning layers).

### Handling state flickering

The most common production problem is rapid state oscillation causing excessive trading. Four solutions, in order of preference:

1. **Probability threshold**: Only switch regime if $P(\text{new state}) > 0.75$ or 0.80, not just 0.50. Nystrup et al. (2018) used a threshold of 0.9998 for allocation changes.
2. **Persistence filter**: Require the new state to persist for $N$ consecutive days (e.g., $N = 3$) before acting. This adds $N$ days of lag but eliminates one-day flickers.
3. **Exponential smoothing**: Apply EMA to filtered probabilities: $\tilde{p}_t = \alpha \cdot p_t + (1-\alpha) \cdot \tilde{p}_{t-1}$, with $\alpha = 0.1{-}0.3$.
4. **Jump penalty tuning** (SJM only): Increase $\lambda$ to enforce greater persistence at the model level rather than post-processing.

```python
# --- Persistence filter implementation ---
def persistence_filter(probs, threshold=0.75, min_days=3):
    """Only switch regime when probability exceeds threshold
    for min_days consecutive days."""
    current_regime = 0  # start in bull
    regimes = np.zeros(len(probs))
    bear_count = 0

    for t in range(len(probs)):
        p_bear = 1 - probs[t]  # P(bear)
        if p_bear > threshold:
            bear_count += 1
        else:
            bear_count = 0

        if bear_count >= min_days:
            current_regime = 1  # switch to bear
        elif probs[t] > threshold and current_regime == 1:
            # Require bull confirmation too
            current_regime = 0

        regimes[t] = current_regime
    return regimes
```

### Integration with pullback trading system

The regime probability multiplier integrates at the position sizing stage of your existing pullback-in-uptrend system:

```python
def compute_position_size(signal_strength, regime_prob_bull,
                          ensemble_entropy, estimated_vol,
                          target_vol=0.10, kelly_fraction=0.5,
                          min_size=0.15, max_size=1.0):
    """
    Compute final position size for a pullback trade.

    Parameters:
    - signal_strength: float, quality of pullback setup (0-1)
    - regime_prob_bull: float, ensemble P(bull) after persistence filter
    - ensemble_entropy: float, normalized entropy of model ensemble (0-1)
    - estimated_vol: float, annualized estimated volatility
    - target_vol: float, target portfolio volatility
    """
    # Layer 1: Regime-based sizing (sigmoid mapping)
    k = 10  # steepness
    regime_mult = min_size + (max_size - min_size) / (
        1 + np.exp(-k * (regime_prob_bull - 0.5))
    )

    # Layer 2: Disagreement penalty
    disagreement_penalty = 1.0 - 0.5 * ensemble_entropy

    # Layer 3: Volatility targeting
    vol_scale = min(target_vol / estimated_vol, 1.5)  # cap leverage

    # Layer 4: Kelly-inspired scaling
    kelly_scale = kelly_fraction

    # Combine all layers
    raw_size = signal_strength * regime_mult * disagreement_penalty
    final_size = np.clip(raw_size * vol_scale * kelly_scale,
                         min_size * kelly_fraction, max_size)

    return final_size
```

### Overfitting safeguards

The total free parameter count for the recommended architecture is approximately **10–15**: 6 HMM parameters + 1 SJM jump penalty + 2–3 ensemble weights + 2–3 position sizing function parameters. With 4,000+ daily observations, this provides >250 observations per parameter — well within safe limits. Walk-forward validation with 2-year training / 6-month test / 3-month step is the gold standard (Pardo, 2008). Monitor three red flags: (1) IS-to-OOS Sharpe degradation exceeding 50%, (2) parameter instability across adjacent training windows (regime means shifting by >1 standard error), and (3) regime-conditional return distributions failing Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests against Gaussian assumptions.

## Conclusion: what the evidence actually supports

The quantitative regime detection literature, spanning Hamilton (1989) through Shu et al. (2024), converges on several actionable conclusions. **Two-state models are sufficient for tactical equity trading** — the additional complexity of 3+ states is justified only for multi-asset strategic allocation. **Statistical Jump Models represent the strongest currently available alternative to HMMs**, offering explicit persistence control, no distributional assumptions, and the most robust out-of-sample evidence across multiple international equity markets. The VIX term structure — particularly the VIX/VIX3M ratio and its z-score — provides the fastest regime signal, complementing the slower but more statistically grounded HMM/SJM approach.

The most underappreciated insight from this research is Nystrup et al.'s (2015) observation that "the purpose of regime-based strategies is not to predict regime shifts, but to **identify when a shift has occurred and benefit from the persistence of equilibrium returns and volatilities.**" This reframing matters for Halcyon Lab: the goal is not to avoid every drawdown but to reduce exposure during persistent bear states while maintaining maximum exposure during the bull states where your pullback system generates returns.

The recommended upgrade path is phased: (1) implement a 2-state SJM using `jumpmodels` with VIX/VIX3M and credit spread features alongside your existing Traffic Light, (2) replace discrete position sizing buckets with the continuous sigmoid mapping, (3) add Bayesian model averaging across the SJM, a parallel HMM, and VIX term structure signals, (4) integrate volatility targeting as a scaling layer. Each phase is independently testable via walk-forward validation and can be rolled back without affecting the others. The Wasserstein HMM approach should be monitored but not adopted until peer-reviewed replication appears. Expected net improvement: **Sharpe +0.05 to +0.15, maximum drawdown reduction of 15–25%**, with the primary value in drawdown control rather than return enhancement — exactly what a pullback system trading 2–15 day holding periods needs most.
