## 3. Top 10 Capability Gaps

| # | Capability | Why It Matters | Feasible for Solo GPU? | Priority |
|---|-----------|----------------|:----------------------:|----------|
| 1 | **Walk-forward backtesting** | Without it, you don't know if your strategy works historically. Every institution runs this. Prevents overfitting. | Yes (CPU-only) | Phase 1 — Critical |
| 2 | **Multiple uncorrelated strategies** | Single-strategy risk is catastrophic. 3+ uncorrelated strategies can double Sharpe. Signal zoo already captures setups for this. | Yes | Phase 2 |
| 3 | **Ensemble model approach** | Combining many weak models outperforms single strong models. Numerai's meta-model proves this at scale. | Yes (lightweight models) | Phase 2 |
| 4 | **Historical backfill** | Can't compute meaningful statistics on weeks of data. Need 5+ years of simulated trades to build confidence. | Yes | Phase 1 — Critical |
| 5 | **Factor breadth** | 200+ features (Kavout) vs ~20 features (Halcyon). More features = more alpha signals, if properly regularized. | Partially (some alt data requires $$$) | Phase 2-3 |
| 6 | **Tick-level execution analysis** | Measuring slippage, fill quality, market impact. Institutional firms optimize this for basis points. | Yes (Alpaca provides fills) | Phase 2 |
| 7 | **Cross-asset signals** | VIX, bond yields, credit spreads, and currency moves predict equity behavior. We collect some; need to use them as features. | Yes | Phase 2 |
| 8 | **Stress testing / scenario analysis** | How does the portfolio behave in a 2008, 2020, or 2022 scenario? Institutions do this daily. | Yes | Phase 2 |
| 9 | **Real-time portfolio correlation monitoring** | Knowing if your "diversified" positions are actually correlated is critical in drawdowns. | Yes | Phase 2 |
| 10 | **Alternative data integration** | Satellite imagery, credit card data, web scraping. Institutional edge. Most requires $50K+ annual data fees. | Limited (web scraping only) | Phase 3+ / Never for satellite |

## 4. Top 5 Genuine Differentiators

| # | Differentiator | Is It Real? | Who Else Does It? |
|---|---------------|:-----------:|-------------------|
| 1 | **LLM-generated trade commentary with self-blinding pipeline** | **Yes, genuinely rare.** Self-blinding (hiding outcomes during training data generation) is research-grade methodology that no retail tool implements. The LLM commentary itself is novel — most systems output scores, not narratives. | No retail competitor. Numerai has encrypted features (different approach). |
| 2 | **5-Agent AI Council (Modified Delphi)** | **Yes, unique in retail.** Multi-agent deliberation for strategic decisions is cutting-edge. The 3-round protocol (independent → cross-examination → final vote) mirrors institutional investment committees but with AI agents. | Not seen in any competitor at this level. |
| 3 | **Signal zoo logging non-traded setups** | **Yes, underrated.** Capturing breakout, momentum, and mean-reversion signals even when not trading them builds a future strategy pipeline. Most systems only log what they trade. | QuantConnect captures all backtest signals, but not as a live "zoo" of real-time non-traded setups. |
| 4 | **Integrated training flywheel (live trades → training data → better model)** | **Yes, but unproven.** The architecture is sound — closed trades generate training examples that improve the model. But with zero closed trades, the flywheel hasn't turned yet. Once it does, this is powerful. | Numerai has a version of this (tournament → model improvement). No retail tool has it. |
| 5 | **Full-stack from data collection to cloud dashboard to Telegram commands** | **Partially unique.** The breadth of the integrated system is impressive for a solo build. But Trade Ideas and TrendSpider also offer end-to-end experiences (just not custom). The specific combination (LLM + council + health scoring + compute scheduler + real-time dashboard + Telegram) is unique in totality. | No single competitor has all these pieces. Each has some subset. |

**Honest assessment:** Differentiators #1 and #2 are genuinely rare and valuable. #3 and #4 are valuable but unproven. #5 is more about integration breadth than any single unique capability.

## 5. Monthly Tracking Framework

### 5 Core Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Phase 1 (Good) | Phase 2 (Good) | Phase 3 (Good) | Red Flag |
|--------|---------|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------:|
| **Win Rate** | Wins / Total Closed Trades | >55% (n>50) | >58% (n>200) | >60% (n>500) | <45% for 20+ trades |
| **Expectancy per Trade** | Avg(P&L per trade) | >$2/trade | >$5/trade | >$10/trade | Negative for 30+ trades |
| **Sharpe Ratio (annualized)** | (Avg daily return / Std daily return) * sqrt(252) | >0.5 | >1.0 | >1.5 | <0 for 3+ months |
| **Max Drawdown** | Max peak-to-trough decline | <15% | <10% | <8% | >20% at any point |
| **Training Data Growth** | Training examples added per week | >20/week | >50/week | >100/week | 0 for 2+ weeks |

### 2 Convergence Metrics

| Metric | Formula | What It Shows |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Alpha vs SPY** | (Portfolio return - SPY return) annualized | Whether you're beating buy-and-hold. Must be positive by Phase 2. |
| **Strategy Count** | # of independent strategies generating trades | Diversification progress. Target 3+ by Phase 3. |

### How to Measure

- **Win Rate & Expectancy:** Direct from `shadow_trades` table (already tracked)
- **Sharpe Ratio:** Compute from daily portfolio P&L series. Need 60+ trading days minimum.
- **Max Drawdown:** Track cumulative P&L peak; measure distance from peak at each point.
- **Training Data:** Count from `training_examples` table (already tracked in data asset report)
- **Alpha vs SPY:** Compare cumulative portfolio return against SPY buy-and-hold over same period.

## 6. Benchmark Returns

| Benchmark | Recent Performance | Relevance to Halcyon Lab |
|-----------|:------------------:|--------------------------|
| **S&P 500 Buy-and-Hold** | +24% (2024), ~16% (2025), 10-year avg ~15.6%/yr | The minimum bar. If you can't beat this, use an index fund. |
| **10-Year Treasury (Risk-Free)** | ~4.2% yield (late 2025), trending toward 3.8% | Opportunity cost. Your Sharpe numerator is return minus this rate. |
| **Connors RSI Pullback (Academic)** | ~30% annual (multi-stock, 1999-present), 75% win rate, 35% max DD | Direct strategy benchmark. Halcyon's pullback approach should target similar returns. |
| **Best Retail Algo Tools** | Trade Ideas Holly claims 60-65% win rate. No auditable returns. | Comparison for signal quality. Most retail tools don't publish auditable returns. |
| **Numerai (Emerging)** | 25.45% (2024), 8% through Oct 2025. Sharpe ~1.5-2.0 | Aspirational benchmark. If Halcyon reaches Numerai's Sharpe, you're competitive. |
| **Two Sigma / Citadel** | ~15-18% annualized, Sharpe 1.5-2.0 | Gold standard for risk-adjusted returns. Their edge is resources, not just strategy. |
| **Medallion Fund** | ~66% before fees (historical). Sharpe ~5+. | Unreachable benchmark. Useful for humility, not targeting. |

### Realistic Targets by Phase

| Phase | Target Return | Target Sharpe | Target Win Rate | Benchmark Comparison |
|-------|:------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|---------------------|
| Phase 1 (1-6 months) | Beat risk-free (>4%) | >0.5 | >55% | Must establish basic profitability |
| Phase 2 (6-18 months) | Beat SPY (~12-16%) | >1.0 | >58% | Competitive with best retail tools |
| Phase 3 (18-36 months) | >20% annualized | >1.5 | >60% | Approaching Numerai / emerging tier |

## 7. Specific Recommendations

### To Move from Tier 1 Retail → Tier 2 Emerging:

1. **Build the track record first.** Nothing else matters until you have 50+ closed trades with measurable statistics. This is your Phase 1 gate for a reason.

2. **Add a walk-forward backtester.** Use historical data to simulate what your system would have done over the past 5 years. This gives you confidence intervals and identifies regime-specific weaknesses.

3. **Activate the signal zoo.** You're already logging breakout, momentum, and mean-reversion setups. Building even one additional strategy from this data doubles your strategy count and reduces single-strategy risk.

4. **Expand the feature set.** Go from ~20 features to 50+ by incorporating your existing collected data (options IV, put/call ratios, VIX term structure slope, FRED macro indicators) as direct features in the ranking model.

5. **Historical backfill.** Simulate your current strategy against 3-5 years of historical data. This doesn't require GPU — just OHLCV data and your feature engine running on CPU.

### Priority Matrix

| Priority | Action | Effort | Impact |
|----------|--------|:------:|:------:|
| **NOW** | Close 50 trades (Phase 1 gate) | Time | Critical |
| **Phase 1** | Walk-forward backtester | 2-3 weeks | High |
| **Phase 1** | Historical backfill simulation | 1-2 weeks | High |
| **Phase 2** | Second strategy from signal zoo | 2-4 weeks | High |
| **Phase 2** | Feature expansion (50+ features) | 2-3 weeks | Medium |
| **Phase 2** | Slippage/execution analysis | 1 week | Medium |
| **Phase 3** | Ensemble models | 3-4 weeks | Medium |
| **Phase 3** | Cross-asset signals as features | 2-3 weeks | Medium |
| **Never** | Satellite data, HFT infrastructure | $$$ | Low for our timeframe |
