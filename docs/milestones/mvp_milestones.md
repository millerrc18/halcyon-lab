### M14 — halcyon-v1 Training
- Scored 976 examples with process-first rubric
- Leakage check: MARGINAL (60.2% balanced accuracy — feature-level, not leakage)
- Trained halcyon-v1: Qwen3 8B fine-tuned on 790 examples via PEFT + TRL 0.24

- Auto-refresh on all pages (Dashboard 60s, Ledger 30s, Training 60s)
- Action buttons (scan, CTO report, collect training, train pipeline, score)
- Live activity feed with color-coded events
- Config restart warning banner
- 13 research documents on Docs page with category grouping

### M16 — 24/7 Operations
- Overnight schedule: post-close capture, training collection, news ingestion, enrichment pre-cache, pre-market refresh
- Unified train-pipeline command (score → leakage → classify → train)
- `--overnight` flag for watch loop

### M17 — Data Collection Pipeline
- Options chain snapshots (EOD, full universe via yfinance)
- Options derived metrics (IV rank, put/call ratios, IV skew, unusual activity)
- VIX term structure (VIX, VIX9D, VIX3M, VIX1Y + ratios)
- CBOE put/call ratios
- Expanded FRED macro (14 series including GSCPI, yield curve, credit spreads)
- Google Trends attention signal (batched rotation)
- 9:30 PM overnight slot + manual CLI command

### M18 — Research & Strategy
- 13 research documents completed (training, strategy, business, options)
- Business model pivot: investing returns → fund management
- Universe expansion decision: S&P 100 → ~325 stocks (Phase 2)
- Options trading strategy designed (credit spreads, iron condors, LLM as volatility analyst)
- 5-phase roadmap with fund-grade gate metrics
- Comprehensive codebase audit (100 files, 15,556 lines)

### M19 — Tech Debt Cleanup (CC Sprint)
- Fixed default equity fallback in risk governor ($5K → config)
- Auto-switch to active model version in LLM client
- Consolidated dual WebSocket connections into shared context
- Silent except-pass → logger.debug across 9 locations
- Unused imports removed, print → logger across 13 modules
- Fixed metric_history days filter bug, resource leak, margin label
- 16 issues fixed (11 known + 5 new), 257 tests passing

### M20 — 24/7 Compute Scheduler
- GuardedScorer: between-scan inference scoring (~420 examples/day, 3-min guard band)
- VRAMManager: evening/morning VRAM handoffs with nvidia-smi monitoring, subprocess isolation
- OvernightPipeline: 7-task pipeline (holdout, DPO, feature importance, leakage, rolling stats, DB maintenance, health)
- PreMarketPipeline: rolling features, training gen, news scoring, candidate pre-analysis
- Schedule metrics table with API endpoint
- 86 new tests (363 total passing)
- GPU utilization target: 2-3% → 73%

### M21 — Telegram Notifications + Earnings Calendar
- Telegram Bot API integration: trade opens/closes, earnings warnings, overnight summary, system events
- Earnings calendar scraper with overnight integration (step 7/7)
- Cached earnings lookup for fast scan-time access
