# AGENTS.md — Halcyon Lab Governance Document

## Purpose

Halcyon Lab is an autonomous AI trading system that scans, analyzes, and executes equity trades. It combines systematic technical scoring with LLM-generated institutional-quality trade commentary, multi-source data enrichment, bracket orders via Alpaca, a risk governor with kill switch, and a self-improving training pipeline with quality gates.

**Core Principle:** Training data quality is our #1 competitive advantage. Never sacrifice quality for speed.

**Business Model:** Investing returns, not newsletter. Scale by growing capital under management. Family LP structure planned for external capital.

**Long-term Goal:** Quantitatively be the best AI autonomous trading platform with an unbeatable technological moat.

## Current System State

The system is live in **bootcamp mode** — shadow paper trading on Alpaca with halcyon-v1 (fine-tuned Qwen3 8B). Full data enrichment, bracket orders, risk governor, daily/weekly auditor, validation holdout, A/B model evaluation, learned confidence, walk-forward backtesting, 24/7 compute scheduler (73% GPU target), comprehensive data collection pipeline, Telegram push notifications, and a 11-page web dashboard (including Live Ledger).

**Active Model:** halcyon-v1 (Qwen3 8B fine-tuned on 790 examples via QLoRA)
**Training Data:** 976 self-blinded examples, scored with process-first rubric
**Universe:** S&P 100 (expanding to ~325 stocks in Phase 2)

## Architecture Overview

```
Universe (S&P 100 → expanding to ~325 stocks)
  → Data Ingestion (yfinance OHLCV)
  → Feature Engine (technical indicators, regime, sector, earnings)
  → Data Enrichment (fundamentals, insiders, news, macro)
  → Ranking & Qualification (score 0-100)
  → Risk Governor (8 checks + kill switch)
  → LLM Packet Writer (Ollama/halcyon-v1 → prose commentary)
  → Shadow Execution (Alpaca bracket orders)
  → Training Loop (self-blinding → scoring → leakage check → curriculum SFT → holdout → A/B eval)
  → Data Collection (options chains, VIX, macro, trends — overnight)
```

## Data Sources (7+ enrichment, 12 collection)

### Enrichment (used in every scan)

1. **Technical Data** — Price, volume, moving averages, RSI, ATR, trend state, relative strength
2. **Market Regime** — SPY trend, volatility, breadth, drawdown, regime classification
3. **Sector Context** — Sector relative strength rank, sector average score
4. **Fundamental Snapshot** — SEC EDGAR: revenue, margins, PE, growth rates
5. **Insider Activity** — Finnhub: buy/sell transactions, sentiment classification
6. **Recent News** — Finnhub Company News: headlines, simple sentiment scoring
7. **Macro Context** — FRED: Fed Funds rate, yield curve, unemployment, CPI, GDP + 9 expanded series

### Data Collection (overnight pipeline — 12 collectors, irreplaceable daily snapshots)

1. **Options Chains** — Full EOD chain snapshots via yfinance (strikes, IV, Greeks, OI)
2. **Options Metrics** — Derived signals: IV rank, put/call ratios, IV skew, unusual activity
3. **VIX Term Structure** — VIX, VIX9D, VIX3M, VIX1Y + contango/backwardation classification
4. **CBOE Ratios** — Equity, index, and total put/call ratios
5. **FRED Macro (34+ series)** — Housing, employment, trade, consumer, financial conditions, plus original core
6. **Google Trends (market-wide)** — 8 sentiment terms: crash, recession, inflation, rates, bubble, correction
7. **Earnings Calendar** — Next earnings date for every ticker, flagging imminent reports
8. **SEC EDGAR Filings** — 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K filings with parsed sections (free, 10 req/sec)
9. **Insider Transactions** — Form 4 buy/sell data via Finnhub (nightly)
10. **Short Interest** — FINRA short interest snapshots via Finnhub (biweekly)
11. **Fed Communications** — FOMC statements, minutes, Beige Book, speeches (scraped from federalreserve.gov)
12. **Analyst Estimates** — Consensus recommendations + price targets via Finnhub (batched 20/night)

## Execution

- **Bracket Orders**: Entry + stop-loss + take-profit via Alpaca paper trading
- **Risk Governor**: 8 checks (emergency halt, daily loss, position size, max positions, sector concentration, correlation, volatility halt, duplicate check)
- **Kill Switch**: `halt-trading` command or dashboard button halts all new positions immediately

## Training Pipeline

1. **Self-Blinding Generation**: Claude generates commentary WITHOUT seeing outcomes (2-stage pipeline)
2. **Process-First Quality Scoring**: LLM-as-judge scores 6 dimensions, blind to trade outcome
3. **Outcome Leakage Detection**: Balanced accuracy classifier verifies pipeline integrity
4. **Curriculum Classification**: Easy/medium/hard difficulty → 3-stage curriculum
5. **SFT Training**: Three-stage curriculum with decreasing learning rates (PEFT + TRL 0.24)
6. **DPO Refinement**: Preference pairs for alignment (after 100+ pairs)
7. **Holdout Validation**: 15% chronological holdout with 5-day temporal gap
8. **A/B Shadow Evaluation**: New model runs alongside current model
9. **Auto-Rollback**: Performance regression triggers automatic rollback

## Scope

### In Scope

- S&P 100 universe (expanding to ~325 stocks), long-only equity swing trades (2-15 day holds)
- Systematic scoring + LLM commentary + bracket execution
- Self-improving training pipeline with quality gates
- Risk management with automated safety rails
- Passive options/volatility data collection

### Out of Scope (Current Phase)

- Options trading (passive data collection only — Options Volatility Desk in Phase 3-4)
- Short selling
- High-frequency / intraday trading (Intraday Desk is Phase 6+)
- Live trading with real money (Phase 2)

### Future Desks (Gated by Performance)

Each desk launches only after the previous desk is profitable. See docs/roadmap.md for full specifications.

- **Equity Research Desk** (Phase 2) — Same model, lower thresholds (score ≥ 30), separate paper account, training data volume
- **Options Volatility Desk** (Phase 3-4) — Separate LoRA adapter, credit spreads + iron condors, 15-check non-linear risk governor
- **Equity Momentum Desk** (Phase 5) — Separate LoRA adapter, Russell 1000, breakout/trend-following (LOW correlation with Swing)
- **Intraday Desk** (Phase 6+) — Separate model entirely, 1-min bars, VWAP reversion, requires dedicated GPU + real-time data
- **Future:** Event-Driven Desk, Macro/Rates Desk, Crypto Desk
