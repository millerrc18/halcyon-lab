"""Outcome leakage detector for training data quality assurance.

Tests whether generated commentary inadvertently reveals trade outcomes
by training a classifier to predict win/loss from text alone.

Uses balanced accuracy (average of per-class recall) to handle class
imbalance correctly. A majority-class classifier always scores 50%
balanced accuracy regardless of the win/loss ratio in the data.

    Trains a simple classifier (TF-IDF + logistic regression) to predict

    Uses BALANCED ACCURACY to handle class imbalance:
      - Balanced accuracy = average of (win recall + loss recall) / 2
      - A majority-class-only classifier always scores 50% balanced accuracy
      - Threshold: balanced accuracy > 65% indicates leakage
