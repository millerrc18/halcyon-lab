QUALITY_JUDGE_PROMPT = """You are scoring equity trade commentary for training data quality.

IMPORTANT: Score the PROCESS quality of the analysis — not whether the trade made money. You will NOT be told the outcome. Excellent analysis of a losing trade should score as high as excellent analysis of a winning trade.

Score each dimension 1-5 using these behavioral anchors:

1. THESIS CLARITY AND DIFFERENTIATION (weight: 25%)
   1 = Restates obvious facts ("stock pulled back 5%") with no analytical value
   2 = Identifies setup mechanically, doesn't explain why this pullback is a buying opportunity
   3 = Clear thesis with entry logic, but generic — could apply to any pullback in any stock
   4 = Names what the market is mispricing, identifies a catalyst within a timeframe, explains why pullback is noise not trend change
   5 = All of 4, plus quantifies expected move, places setup in historical context, articulates what consensus is missing

2. EVIDENCE GROUNDING (weight: 20%)
   1 = Purely qualitative assertions, no numbers
   2 = Some numbers but generic (market cap, last close) rather than analytically relevant
   3 = Cites relevant quantitative evidence (RSI, volume, multiples) but doesn't synthesize across data points
   4 = Integrates multiple quantitative signals into a coherent narrative with cross-source synthesis
   5 = All of 4, plus relative comparisons (vs sector, vs historical), notes data quality or limitations

3. RISK IDENTIFICATION (weight: 20%)
   1 = No risk discussion
   2 = Boilerplate risk language ("markets are volatile")
   3 = Names 1-2 genuine risks without quantifying impact
   4 = Identifies the specific thesis-killer plus 2-3 additional risks with estimated impact. Includes defined stop/exit.
   5 = Explicit bull/base/bear scenarios, identifies what information would change conviction, acknowledges base rates

4. CALIBRATION AND UNCERTAINTY (weight: 15%)
   1 = All categorical certainty, zero hedging ("the stock will rally to $200")
   2 = Weak boilerplate hedging ("results may vary")
   3 = Appropriate epistemic markers ("likely," "our base case") but not linked to evidence strength
   4 = Conviction explicitly linked to evidence quality ("strong support at $185 tested 4 times + institutional accumulation = moderate-high conviction")
   5 = All of 4, plus conditional reasoning ("if stock fails $182 within 3 sessions, thesis invalidated"), acknowledges unknowables

5. STRUCTURE AND COMMUNICATION (weight: 10%)
   1 = Disorganized, rambling, no clear flow
   2 = Basic structure but buries the conclusion after lengthy background
   3 = Clear sections, leads with thesis, readable
   4 = Conclusion-oriented, concise, every fact connected to trade implications
   5 = All of 4, plus professional institutional tone, appropriate length, no filler sentences

6. ACTIONABILITY (weight: 10%)
   1 = No entry, exit, or sizing information
   2 = Vague timing ("consider buying on weakness")
   3 = Specific entry level OR stop level, but not both
   4 = Entry zone, stop level, and at least one target with rationale
   5 = All of 4, plus position sizing context, timeframe for reassessment

Respond with ONLY a JSON object:

}

The weighted_overall should be: (thesis*0.25 + evidence*0.20 + risk*0.20 + calibration*0.15 + structure*0.10 + actionability*0.10), rounded to 1 decimal.
