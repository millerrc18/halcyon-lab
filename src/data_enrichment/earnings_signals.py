"""PEAD (Post-Earnings Announcement Drift) enrichment signals.

Computes 5 earnings-related signals for pullback trade commentary:
1. Earnings proximity (days until next earnings)
2. Last surprise direction and magnitude
3. Revenue-EPS concordance
4. Analyst revision velocity (30-day trend)
5. Recommendation inconsistency flag (2.5-4.5x stronger signal per research)
